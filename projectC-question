# Walmart Payment System ðŸ›’
Imagine youâ€™re creating a simple program to help a supermarket keep track of prices and calculate the total cost of items customers buy.

Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

Create a dictionary where the key is the name of an item (e.g., 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Milk') and the value is the price of that item.
Ask the customer how many different items they want to buy and which items they want from the dictionary.
For each item, ask how many they want, and then calculate the total price for that item.
At the end, show the total amount the customer needs to pay for everything.
You must use:

A dictionary to store item names and prices.
A function that calculates the total cost.
Loops to keep asking the customer about items.
math functions, like round(), to make sure the total cost is shown neatly.

---------------------------------------
This is how your console answer should look like:

If the customer buys 2 apples and 3 bananas, your program should calculate the total cost and print something like this:


You have bought:
2 Apples - $3.00
3 Bananas - $1.50

Total amount to pay: $4.50
