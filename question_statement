Design an Adventure Game:
In this game, the player will explore different places to find hidden treasures.
The goal is to visit as many places as possible, collect treasures, and avoid going to the same place more than once.
The game will keep track of the treasures the player has found and the places they've already visited.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Write a Python program that:

Uses conditions to determine whether a location has a treasure.
Uses loops to allow the player to explore multiple locations.
Uses lists to store the available locations and treasures.
Uses a dictionary to map locations to either treasures or empty spots.
Uses print() with sep and end to customize game messages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Game Rules:
The player starts the game with a list of unexplored locations.
Some locations contain treasures, while others do not.
The player can choose a location to explore, and the program will check whether there's a treasure in that location.
Once a location is explored, it is removed from the list of available locations.
The game continues until all locations are explored or the player decides to stop playing.
The game tracks the player's collected treasures and prints a summary at the end.
